\title{Unmapped Concepts Input File (OMOP)}
\format{
\subsection{\code{uc_input_omop}}{

A dataframe or CSV file with 8 columns
\describe{
\item{check_id}{A short string "code" used to identify the specific check (ex: de, de_rx)}
\item{check_description}{A longer description of the check (ex: full drug_exposure table, prescribed drugs based on drug_type_concept_id)}
\item{schema}{The schema where the data is kept. Use \code{cdm} to use the pre-configured \code{cdm_schema}, \code{result} to use the preconfigured \code{results_schema}, or input the exact name of the schema.}
\item{table}{The name of the CDM or pre-computed results table where the relevant data is kept}
\item{concept_field}{The *_concept_id field with the concepts that make up the valueset (ex: drug_concept_id, drug_source_concept_id)}
\item{source_value_field}{For analyses where \code{produce_mapped_list == TRUE}, the *_source_value field linked to the concept_field of interest to be used to produce a list of source values associated with unmapped concepts}
\item{date_field}{For analyses where \code{by_year == TRUE}, the date field to be used to retrieve the year associted with the unmapped concepts}
\item{filter_logic}{\strong{OPTIONAL} The logic that should be applied to the provided table in order to tailor the tables to the desired check assessment (ex: if you only want to identify prescription drugs that are unmapped)}

\usage{
uc_input_omop
}
\description{
A sample version of an OMOP compliant input file for
the Unmapped Concepts data quality module. This exact
file is also included as a CSV in the package if the user wishes
to use it, or the structure can be copied to produce a custom
list of checks.
