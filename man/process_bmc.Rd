\title{Best Mapped Concepts -- Processing}
\usage{
process_bmc(
  bmc_results,
  bmc_concepts_labelled,
  rslt_source = "remote",
  csv_rslt_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bmc_results}{\emph{tabular input} || \strong{required}

The \code{bmc_counts} output of \code{check_bmc}. This table should include results for all
institutions that should be included in the computation of overall / "network level"
statistics.}

\item{bmc_concepts_labelled}{\emph{tabular input} || \strong{required}

The \code{bmc_concepts} output of \code{check_bmc}, with an additional  column called \code{include}
added with "not best" or non-ideal concepts marked with a 0
(optionally, "best" concepts can also be marked with a 1)}

\item{rslt_source}{\emph{string} || defaults to \code{remote}

A string that identifies the location of the \code{bmc_results} table.
Acceptable values are
\itemize{
\item \code{local} - table is stored as a dataframe in the local R environment
\item \code{csv} - table is stored as a CSV file
\item \code{remote} - table is stored on a remote database
}}

\item{csv_rslt_path}{\emph{string} || defaults to \code{NULL}

If \code{rslt_source} has been set to \code{csv}, this parameter should indicate the path to
the result file(s). Otherwise, this parameter can be left as \code{NULL}}
}
\value{
This function will return a list of two dataframes:
\itemize{
\item \code{bmc_output_pp}: A table summarizing the proportion of best vs not best
concepts for a given check, indicated by the user designation in the
\code{bmc_concepts_labelled} table
\item \code{bmc_concepts_pp}: The \code{bmc_results} input table with the best / not best designations
added
}
}
\description{
Intakes the output of \code{check_bmc} in order to apply additional processing. This
includes applying the user-specified best/not best labels that were added to
the \code{bmc_concepts} table, then using those labels to compute proportions of
best vs not best concept representation in each check.
}
\examples{
# This function should be run after check_bmc has been executed for all
# network institutions and results have been combined into a common table

# All returned concepts should also be labelled to indicate whether they
# should be included as a "best" concept or not:

readr::read_csv(system.file('extdata', 'bmc_concept_examples.csv', package = 'ndq'))

# Once the labels have been applied, the function can be executed
## When results are kept locally:
\dontrun{
my_bmc_process <- process_bmc(bmc_results = my_bmc_rslts,
                              bmc_concepts_labelled = my_bmc_concepts,
                              rslt_source = 'local')
}

## When results are kept in CSV files:
\dontrun{
my_bmc_process <- process_bmc(bmc_results = 'my_bmc_rslts',
                              bmc_concepts_labelled = 'my_bmc_concepts',
                              rslt_source = 'csv',
                              csv_rslt_path = 'path/to/my/results')
}

## When results are kept on a remote database:
\dontrun{
my_bmc_process <- process_bmc(bmc_results = 'my_bmc_rslts',
                              bmc_concepts_labelled = 'my_bmc_concepts',
                              rslt_source = 'remote')
}

}
