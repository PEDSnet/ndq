Description: The Network Data Quality (NDQ) package contains several data quality 
    modules intended to evaluate the overall condition of the data in a clinical 
    research network. These modules, which cover a broad range of data quality 
    domains from conformance to plausibility, are flexible and can be configured to 
    execute checks specific to desired use cases in both the OMOP and PCORnet 
    common data models (CDMs).
